Till 24.05

- [ ] Establish the threshold for effective drugs. **Lea+Lennard**
- [x] Create another file which includes all steps that are planned or have been done concerning the questions, small summary. **Ilya**
- [ ] Removing irrelevant colums/rows from datasets. **Cedrik**

Till 31.05
- [ ] Do we want to select just effective drugs in all 34 cell lines or we want to select effective drugs specifically for each of 4 subtypes? Somebody needs to look into it and see if it is worth it or not. **Xenia**
- [x] Solve the "Filter effective drugs" problem. **Ilya**
- [x] Select the drugs that are effective in multiple doses. **Ilya**
- [ ] Select drug targets. **Ilya**

For future:
