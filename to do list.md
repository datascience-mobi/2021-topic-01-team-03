Till 24.05
- [x] Establish how big can be the deviation of non-standard doses, from the standard ones. **Teamwork Xenia & Ilya <3**
- [x] Establish the threshold for effective drugs. **Lea+Lennard**
- [x] Create another file which includes all steps that are planned or have been done concerning the questions, small summary. **Ilya**
- [ ] Removing irrelevant colums/rows from datasets. **Cedrik**

Till 31.05
- [ ] Do we want to select just effective drugs in all 34 cell lines or we want to select effective drugs specifically for each of 4 subtypes? Somebody needs to look into it and see if it is worth it or not. **Xenia**
- [x] Solve the "Filter effective drugs" problem. **Ilya**
- [x] Select the drugs that are effective in multiple doses. **Ilya**
- [ ] Select drug targets. **Ilya**
- [x] Why is the threshold 0,3 and not 0? **Lea**
- [ ] Look into how effective_in_all_doses drugs vary in their effect on cell proliferation, depending on the dose (in brain_cancer data frame). Look for trends and create groups from drugs that have similarities. **Lea**
- [ ] Which cell lines miss from achilles? Who? **Cedrik**
- [ ] Find a way to justify the 0,3. **Lennard**
- [ ] Clustering 0,3 threshold and 160 cell line. **Cedrik**

Till 7.06
- [ ] **What to do with the drug targets? How to examine gene targetsÂ of the effective drugs and what to do with them? How do we work further? (prism.treat + prism.achilles + prism.cnv)**
- [ ] Determine specific drugs for each brain cancer subtype. Who? 
- [ ] Find a relationship between gene targets and brain cancer subtypes. Who? 
- [ ] Work on brain_cancer_treat and brain_cancer_cnv. See what is the norm there is. Generate general information and visualisation of this dataframs. Who?
- [ ] Work on brain_cancer_treat and brain_cancer_cnv. See how gene targets of drugs perform in our cell lines Who?
- [ ] Work on brain_cancer_treat and brain_cancer_cnv. See if there is any specific characteristics for the cancer subtypes. Who?

Till 14.06
- [ ] Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Who?


In the pipeline:
- [ ] Try to find a way to store long codes in loops just to make it more professional (when enough time for it)
- [ ] What happens with drugs which are effective but dose dependant?
