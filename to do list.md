Till 24.05
- [x] Establish how big can be the deviation of non-standard doses, from the standard ones. **Teamwork Xenia & Ilya <3**
- [x] Establish the threshold for effective drugs. **Lea+Lennard**
- [x] Create another file which includes all steps that are planned or have been done concerning the questions, small summary. **Ilya**
- [ ] Removing irrelevant colums/rows from datasets. **Cedrik**

Till 31.05
- [ ] Do we want to select just effective drugs in all 34 cell lines or we want to select effective drugs specifically for each of 4 subtypes? Somebody needs to look into it and see if it is worth it or not. **Xenia**
- [x] Solve the "Filter effective drugs" problem. **Ilya**
- [x] Select the drugs that are effective in multiple doses. **Ilya**
- [ ] Select drug targets. **Ilya**
- [ ] Why is the threshold 0,3 and not 0? **Lea**



For future:
- [ ] trying to find a way to store long codes in loops just to make it more professional (when enough time for it)
- [ ] what happens with drugs which are effective but dose dependant?
