General structure:
Main question: Is it possible to predict the effectiveness of a drug?
Further breakdown:
1) How can we distinguish the most effective drugs?
- Create separate data frames for each dose
- Define the threshold to select effective drugs
- Find drugs that are effective in mutiple doses


2) What are the targets of the effective drugs?
3) Are there any genetic markers that are specific for brain cancer subtypes?
- Examine gene targets of the effective drugs
- Find a relationship between gene targets and brain cancer subtypes
- Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test


4) What other factors contribute to drug and effectiveness prediction? 
- Estimate the relevant variables
- Look for correlations between variables and leave only variables with high variance
- Reduce the amount of dimesions by conducting a PCA
- Regression model with PCA
- Compare the real effectiveness with the estimated one
